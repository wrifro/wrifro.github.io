I created this post by modifying the file posts/example-blog-post/index.ipynb in VSCode. You can also use JupyterLab for this editing if you prefer. Finally, it is possible to write blog posts without using notebooks by writing .qmd files, as illustrated here."

    "text": "Math\nIn addition to regular text using the Markdown specification, you can also write mathematics, enclosed between dollar signs. The syntax for writing math is very similar to the syntax used in the \\(\\LaTeX\\) markup language. For example, $f(x) \\approx y$ renders to \\(f(x) \\approx y\\). To place complex mathematical expressions on their own lines, use double dollar signs. For example, the expression\n$$\\mathcal{L}(a, b) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (ax_i + b - y_i)^2$$\nrenders to:\n\\[\\mathcal{L}(a, b) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n (ax_i + b - y_i)^2\\;.\\]\nBehind the scenes, math is powered by the MathJax engine. For more on how to write math, check this handy tutorial and quick reference.\n---\ntitle: Intro blog post\nauthor: Wright Frost\ndate: '2023-02-16'\ndescription: 'Just playing around with markdown and quarto'\nformat: html\n---\n\n\n\nI’m going to add some python code:\ndef addTwoNumbers(num_a, num_b):\n    sum = num_a + num_b\n    return sum\naddTwoNumbers(3,5)\n```\n\n\n\nWill this work and make a new post?
